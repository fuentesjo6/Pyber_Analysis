# Pyber Analysis

### Overview of Analysis 

Perform exploratory analysis on large data CSV files and create several visualization aids to better help explain the data. I used these charts to visualize the relationship between the type of city and the number of riders and drivers as well as their percentages. The data will help determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

### Results

  - Rural cities have the lowest total rides but the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) and highest average fare per driver ($55.49).
  - Suburban cities have far less drivers (625) than urban cities (2405) do yet their average fare is about 26% higher.
  - Urban cities average more than 2 times the number of rides than rural and suburban cities combined, more than 4 times the number of drivers, but their     average fares are about 26% less than suburban and about 40% less than rural cities. 
  - We also analyzed 17 weeksâ€™ worth of fares from Jan 1st through April 30th for all 3 city types and found that urban cities totaled $37,065.78 in fares     while suburban totaled $17,883.34 and rural $3,913.69.
